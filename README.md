## unRAID Plug-ins

Our plug-ins try to unlock your unRAID servers potential, adding functionality to your server as well as keeping it easy to use.

Our first releases, Sabnzbd, Sickbeard, Couchpotato_V2, and Headphones apps are all webgui based plugins that streamline your media collection. These apps are popular among
many in the community. Some of these have plug-ins by other authors, we've modified and updated them to remove bugs, add functionality, and introduce new features.



A couple features to note:
* New friendly plugin GUI with useful informations
* Message letting you know at a glance whether your data and configuration files will remain after a reboot
* Indicator letting the user know how much disk space is being used by the application
* Easy to use updater for applications that have spotty updaters or no in-app updater at all, plus update notification
* We are always around to answer questions, setup related and if possible, application related



We hope you enjoy our plug-ins, if you have any issues post them either on the Lime-Technology forums or here on the issues page.
If you want to change or add something interesting in our plugins go ahead, do it and post your commit.
